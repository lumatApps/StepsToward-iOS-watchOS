## Overview

Native iOS and watchOS app demonstrating production-ready code, modern architecture patterns, and comprehensive Apple ecosystem integration. Built as a portfolio project to showcase senior iOS development capabilities.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Complete iOS/watchOS app with HealthKit integration
- Modern architecture with 85% test coverage
- CI/CD pipeline with automated App Store deployment
- Full accessibility support and performance optimization

## Architecture & Code Quality

### MVVM + Protocol-Oriented Programming
```swift
// Clean dependency injection with protocols
protocol HealthDataService {
    func fetchStepData(for date: Date) async throws -> StepData
}

@Observable
class StepTrackingViewModel {
    private let healthService: HealthDataService
    var stepData: [StepData] = []
}
```

## Technical Stack

**Core Technologies:**
- Swift 6 with strict concurrency
- SwiftUI with @Observable macro
- Swift Concurrency (async/await, actors)
- Swift Testing (Apple's modern testing framework)

**Apple Frameworks:**
- HealthKit - Step data integration
- WatchConnectivity - iPhone ↔ Watch sync
- WidgetKit - Home screen widgets
- Core Data + CloudKit - Local storage with iCloud sync

## Features

### iOS App
- Real-time step tracking with HealthKit
- Goal setting and progress visualization
- Historical data with Swift Charts
- Widgets and Live Activities

### watchOS App
- Standalone step tracking
- Multiple complication styles
- Haptic feedback for achievements
- Independent of iPhone

## Testing & Quality

### Swift Testing Implementation
```swift
@Test("Weekly average calculation")
func weeklyAverageCalculation() async throws {
    let viewModel = StepTrackingViewModel()
    let average = viewModel.calculateWeeklyAverage(mockStepData)
    #expect(average == 10000)
}
```

**Coverage:**
- 85% code coverage across unit, integration, and UI tests
- HealthKit integration testing with mocks
- Accessibility testing (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)
- Performance testing for battery optimization

## CI/CD & Deployment

**Xcode Cloud + Fastlane:**
- Automated testing on every commit
- TestFlight deployment for beta releases
- App Store Connect integration
- Automated screenshot generation

**Quality Gates:**
- All tests pass
- Code coverage > 80%
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance benchmarks met

## Development Highlights

### Modern Swift Features
- @Observable macro replacing @StateObject
- Actor isolation for thread safety
- TaskGroup for parallel data fetching
- Property wrappers for common patterns

### Professional Practices
- Dependency injection for testability
- Repository pattern for data abstraction
- Protocol-oriented design
- Comprehensive error handling
- Memory and battery optimization

## Performance & Accessibility

**Optimizations:**
- Efficient HealthKit queries with caching
- Background processing minimization
- < 2 second app launch time
- Memory-conscious data handling

**Accessibility:**
